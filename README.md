# Sudoku Solver

## Overview

The **Sudoku Solver** project is a program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It takes a partially filled Sudoku grid as input and outputs the completed grid by filling in the missing numbers. This project is an example of applying algorithmic techniques to solve a real-world problem.

## Objective

- **Solve Sudoku Puzzles**: Implement a solver that can fill in the missing numbers in a partially completed 9x9 Sudoku grid.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: The solver uses a backtracking approach, which is a form of depth-first search to try different possibilities until it finds the correct solution.
- **Interactive**: The program accepts Sudoku puzzles as input (either via a text file, console, or GUI) and outputs the solution.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python/C++ (or any other language, depending on your implementation)
- **Algorithm**: Backtracking algorithm for solving the puzzle
- **Optional**: Tkinter or PyQt (for GUI version), or any other method of input/output (e.g., file reading)

## Features

- **Input Formats**: Accept Sudoku puzzles in different formats such as 2D arrays, CSV files, or interactive input.
- **Backtracking Approach**: Efficiently solves Sudoku using the backtracking algorithm.
- **Visual Output**: Displays the completed Sudoku grid or provides a textual solution.
- **Validating Sudoku Grids**: Optionally, validates whether a given Sudoku puzzle is solvable before attempting to solve it.
